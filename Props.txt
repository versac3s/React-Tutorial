NOTES - 2

Props are the information you pass along the JSX tag.

PASSING ARRAY TO PROPS
Syntax: 
import Product from "./Product.jsx";
function ProductTab(){
    let features2 = ["Durable","Slim"];
    let features3 = ["High sound","Water resistant"];
    //JSX tag with their props
    return(
        <>
        <Product title="Phone" price={50000} features={{a:"high-tech"}}/> you can directly pass array as well
        <Product title="Laptop" price={80000} features={features2}/>
        <Product title="Headset" price={85000} features={features3}/>
        </>
    );
}
export default ProductTab;

CONDITIONALS
Adding elements in the basis of some conditions.

We have two syntax:
{price>50000? <p>Discount of = 10%</p> : null} this means, if price is abouve 50k, generate p tag and show discount else keep value null
{price>50000 && <p>Discount = 10%</p>} here, the price condition is checked first, if its true only then we move forward and show discount.

DYNAMIC COMPONENT STYLING
Adding style based on some condition.

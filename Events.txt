EVENTS IN REACT: 
1. Handling Click Events
Syntax : 
    function doSomething(){
        here we write the function we want to execute when the button is clicked
    }
    export default function Button(){
        return (
            <div>
            <button onClick={doSomething}>
        )
    }
2. Handling Non-click Events
    export default function Button(){
        return(
            <div>
            <button onMouseOver = {doSomething}>
        )
    }
    onMouseOver is one of the many Events that are present in React.
    Using this event, when we hover over the button, the given function is executed. 
    You can check Event Reference under the mdn web document for more events.

Whenever an Event occurs, an Event Object (associated with the event) is automatically passed to the handler

REACT is a Javascript library developed and maintained by Facebook. 
It is used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
REACT has a component-based architecture that allows you to create reusable UI elements making complex web applications easier to manage and maintain. React is used to build single-page applications.

JSX -Javascript Extension Syntax
It lets us write HTML directly inside JS. 

SET UP LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
Two tools can be used for this set up : Create-React-App or Vite
We will be using Vite because it is comparatively faster (new technology)

command - npm create vite@latest 
1. Enter project name (for ex. first-react-app)
2. Select a framework: React
3. Select variant: Javascript 

Now, to start the server write command: npm run dev
(make sure your terminal is showing that you are in your react folder)

COMPONENT - Resuable and independent piece of code
function Title(){
    return( ); we can return a single element only, ie only single parent element
}
then render the component, syntax: <Title/>

function Title(){
    return(
        <div> ------> here we use div, we are still returning a single element.
            <h1> Hello </h1>
            <p> This is my first app </p>
        </div>
    );
}

Syntax for naming div: <div className = ""> (we can't write <div class ="">)

JSX WITH CURLY BRACES
When we want a segment of a code to e treated as pure JS, we use curly braces.
<p> { js code, variables etc } </p>
